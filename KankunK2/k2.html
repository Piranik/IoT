<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The K2 Smart Plug is a connected wall plug that link to the Kankon Cloud service. With an app, you can remote control the plug to switch on or off, read the current power usage of the appliance that is plugged in or do other things like monitor the temperature and expand the Wi-Fi range, for examples.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>

<p class="p1">Hacking the Smart Plug</p>
<p class="p3">The Kankun K2 runs on OpenWrt - an open Linux environment for small devices, mainly used on routers but gradually expand to cover other kind of hardware including many IoT devices. The past releases of the K2 have many vulnerabilities, telnet connection and open root account - two critical vulnerabilities for an easy start - were no longer available in the latest releases of the K2. However, the device still accept root login via SSH and with this, it is still possible to get into the device, easily if we know the root password. Thanks to Google, the root password for this device is then found and we can start our hacking to turn this into a remote controllable device which is suitable to use with our own deployment.</p>
