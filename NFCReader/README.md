# NFCReader
A test sketch to try out the RFID-RC522 reader and cards.

Logic has written so that three cards are prepared (hardcoded with their serial): READ/WRITE/ERASE
These card set the 3 different states internally to the program. The WRITE card can be used to write a predefined string into any BLANK card - initialize. The READ card is presented so that the Next card presented will be used to match a predefined string and display the matching result on the OLED display. The ERASE card is used to make an Initialized card to become un-initialized by erasing the preset string written to the card.
